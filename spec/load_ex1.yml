  description: "CDF-FRAP compiled the 'best available' land cover data into a single data layer, to support the various analyses required for the 2002 Forest and Range Assessment. Typically the most current and detailed data were collected for various regions of the state or for unique mapping efforts (farmland, wetlands, riparian vegetation). Decision rules were developed that controlled which layers were given priority in areas of overlap. Cross-walks were used to compile the various sources into the common California Wildlife Wabitat Relationships (CWHR) system classification. Data sources had unique scale/resolution, multi-source data provided as 100m GRID. The original 1/2002 data used to support the Asessment is also available from the FRAP site - this record corresponds to the most recent updated version of the data (10/2002), which incorporates better data for the Mojave & NE Colorado Desert areas."
